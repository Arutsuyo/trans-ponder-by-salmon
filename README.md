# trans-ponder-by-salmon

This project is a cloud database backed web app created at the 2018 hack for a cause event for trans*ponder, a non-profit based in Eugene, Oregon.

The web app consists of a listing of resources available to the trans community. Users can add additional resources to the database, which must first be verified by volunteer users who have. Volunteer users can either verify or delete user submitted resource listings.

The resource listings are stored in a cloud nosql database using MongoDB. Team salmon has used a free online hosting service to create a minimal database; a more robust (paid) service will probably be advisable before deploying this app to the web.
